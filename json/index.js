    Exclude backreferences
    In simple cases of circular references, we can exclude an offending property from serialization by its name.

    But sometimes we can't just use the name, as it may be used both in circular references and normal properties. So we can check the properpty by its value.

    Write replacer function to stringify everything, but remove properties that reference meetup
